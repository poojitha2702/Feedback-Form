# Feedback-Form
This project is a Student Feedback System built using Flask (Python) for the backend, MySQL for database management, and HTML/CSS with Bootstrap for the frontend design. It allows students to submit their feedback through a simple web form. The data is stored in a MySQL database and can be viewed through an admin panel.
